# Damian's AKS Quickstart Scenarios

These scenarios are **derived from the official Azure AKS Landing Zone Accelerator templates**, providing a streamlined approach to deploying new workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). While the original accelerator delivers comprehensive architectural guidance and reference implementations for enterprise-scale AKS environments, these quickstart scenarios focus on **accelerating deployment speed** by including only the essential components required for rapid, production-ready AKS cluster provisioning.

For a quick start refer to the [AKS Secure Baseline](https://github.com/OzDoll/aks-landingzone/tree/main/AKS-Secure-Baseline-PrivateCluster).

## Purpose

- **Based on proven AKS Landing Zone Accelerator patterns**
- **Optimized for fast, repeatable deployments**
- **Includes only core modules needed for most workloads**
- **Reduces complexity by omitting non-essential components**

These templates are ideal for teams who need to **quickly provision AKS clusters** for new workloads, without the overhead of a full enterprise landing zone implementation. They maintain alignment with Azure best practices, but are intentionally **“watered down”** to support agility and simplicity.

## Key Features

- **Minimal, production-ready AKS cluster setup**
- **Leverages modular Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**
- **Supports both Bicep and Terraform**
- **Easily extensible for future needs**

## When to Use

- **Rapid prototyping or PoC environments**
- **Workloads that don’t require full enterprise governance**
- **Teams seeking a fast path to AKS adoption with best-practice foundations**
